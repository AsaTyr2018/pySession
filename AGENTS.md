This Git repo is intended for Python training.
It contains various scripts and functions.

Each script includes functions that are defined without comments.
Instead, there are three empty lines separated by bars between the functions for writing.

The individual script files are numbered by difficulty level:

1 = easy
10 = hard

The task for the trainee is to explain/describe the functions.

No hints or assistance are provided in the scripts.
