# pySession

This repository provides a collection of Python scripts for self‑directed training.
Each file `script01.py` to `script10.py` contains several functions. The scripts are numbered
by difficulty where **1** represents the easiest material and **10** the hardest.

The functions intentionally lack explanations. Between them you will find three blank
lines separated by `|` characters. Use these spaces to add your own comments or
docstrings that describe what the functions do.

## How to Work with This Repository

1. **Clone** the repository to your machine.
2. **Create a branch** that uses your last name as the branch name.
3. Edit the scripts by filling the blank comment sections with your descriptions.
   Avoid modifying the functions themselves.
4. **Commit** your changes on your branch yourself. Handling the Git workflow is part
   of your self‑study.

The folder `Lernkontrolle` contains copies of the exercises for confirmation
purposes only. It exists in mutual trust that you will not simply copy from it.

Enjoy exploring Python and documenting what you discover!
